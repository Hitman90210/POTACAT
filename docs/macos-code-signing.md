# macOS code signing + notarization — activation checklist

The desktop build is **already wired** for Developer ID signing, notarization,
and auto-update (commit that added `scripts/notarize.js`, `build/entitlements.mac.plist`,
the `mac` block in `package.json`, and the mac jobs in `.github/workflows/release.yml`).
It is **inert until the five GitHub secrets below exist** — today's CI keeps
producing the same unsigned/ad-hoc DMGs, and `macBuildIsSigned()` in `main.js`
keeps mac auto-update off. The moment the secrets are set, the next tagged
release signs + notarizes automatically and Mac auto-update turns itself on.

Nothing here changes the release routine: you still just push a `vX.Y.Z` tag.

Bundle identifier for the Mac app is **`com.potacat`** (not the Windows
`com.waffleslop.potacat`, and never `co.cmox.*` — that's the ECHOCAT iOS app).

## One-time setup (all on your side — needs your Apple ID)

You already have the Apple Developer Program (team **J693SF7JDR**, via ECHOCAT),
so there's no new membership to buy.

### 1. Create a "Developer ID Application" certificate
- developer.apple.com → Certificates → **+** → **Developer ID Application**.
- Follow the CSR flow (Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant → Request a
  Certificate from a Certificate Authority), upload the CSR, download the cert.
- Double-click to import into your login keychain.
- **This is a different cert type from the iOS distribution cert** — you need
  this specific one for direct-download (non-App-Store) Mac apps.

### 2. Export it as a .p12
- Keychain Access → find "Developer ID Application: … (J693SF7JDR)" → right-click
  → **Export** → `.p12` → set a strong password (you'll store it as a secret).

### 3. Base64-encode the .p12 (that's what CI consumes)
```bash
base64 -i DeveloperID.p12 | pbcopy      # macOS — now in your clipboard
```

### 4. Create an app-specific password for notarization
- appleid.apple.com → Sign-In and Security → **App-Specific Passwords** → **+**
  → name it e.g. "POTACAT notarize". Copy the generated password.

### 5. Add five GitHub repository secrets
Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **New repository secret**:

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `MAC_CSC_LINK` | the base64 string from step 3 |
| `MAC_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | the .p12 export password from step 2 |
| `APPLE_ID` | your Apple ID email |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | the app-specific password from step 4 |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | `J693SF7JDR` |

## Activating it

Push a normal version tag (`git tag v1.11.0 && git push origin v1.11.0`). The
mac jobs will now:
1. import the cert (`CSC_LINK`) and sign with Developer ID,
2. `scripts/notarize.js` submits to Apple and staples the ticket,
3. produce a signed **dmg** (fresh installs) + **zip** (auto-update feed) and
   `latest-mac.yml`, all attached to the release.

CI time goes up a few minutes per mac job (notarization is a round-trip to
Apple). If a secret is missing or wrong, `scripts/notarize.js` logs
`[notarize] skipped …` and the build falls back to unsigned — it won't fail
the release, so check the log if a build you expected to be signed isn't.

## The one manual step for existing Mac users

Auto-update is signed→signed only: a user on an **unsigned** 1.10.x build
cannot auto-update to the first **signed** build (Squirrel.Mac won't swap an
ad-hoc app). They install that first signed DMG by hand, once. Every signed
release after that auto-updates. Worth a line in the release notes for the
first signed version.

## Verifying a build is actually signed + notarized
```bash
codesign -dv --verbose=4 /Applications/POTACAT.app     # Authority=Developer ID Application: … (J693SF7JDR)
spctl -a -vvv -t install /Applications/POTACAT.app      # source=Notarized Developer ID  →  accepted
xcrun stapler validate /Applications/POTACAT.app        # The validate action worked!
```
`macBuildIsSigned()` in `main.js` checks the same `Authority=Developer ID Application`
line to decide whether to enable auto-update, so if `codesign` shows it, the
app will offer updates.
